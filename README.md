MNIST Digit Recognition Project Overview This project aims to create a model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

Dataset The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with each image being 28x28 pixels.
It's split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
